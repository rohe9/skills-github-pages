title:"Personal Interests"

Beyond academia, I enjoy traveling, snowboarding, volunteering, reading, and live music, which have enriched my perspective on diverse cultures and global issues. I am also passionate about teaching, allowing me to apply my knowledge to real-world contexts and contribute positively to communities.
