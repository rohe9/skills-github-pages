title: "Background"
Originally from Xi'an, Shaanxi, I completed my **Bachelor's degree in Economics with a minor in Mathematics** at Colorado State University. Currently, I am pursuing a **Master's degree in Global Development Economics** at Boston University, where I am deepening my understanding of economic policies and their impacts on marginalized communities around the world.
